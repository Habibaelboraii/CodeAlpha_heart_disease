# 🫀 Heart Disease Prediction

This project predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on health and clinical data such as age, cholesterol, blood pressure, and other medical indicators.

## 🎯 Objective
To build and evaluate machine learning models that classify patients as having or not having heart disease.

## 🧠 Models Used
- Logistic Regression  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- Random Forest  
- XGBoost  

## ⚙️ Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing** – handling missing values, encoding, and scaling  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – understanding relationships between features  
3. **Model Training & Evaluation** – using metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score  

## 📊 Results
The models achieved strong performance, helping in early identification of heart disease risk.

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  
- XGBoost  

## 📁 Notebook
The full implementation is available in `heart_disease_prediction.ipynb`.
